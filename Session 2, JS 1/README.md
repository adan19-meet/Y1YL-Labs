## Instructions:

### Part 1 : User I/O 
 - In the `<script>` tags OR your `.js` file, use `console.log` to print `"Hello, World"` to the console.
 - Open the Inspector `(Right Click > Inspect)` in your Browser and look for the Console. 
 - Check to see if `"Hello, World"` was output to the console. If not, refresh and try again.

### Part 2 : Variables, Numbers, and Strings
 - Use prompt to ask the user for the **year they were born**. Store this value as a `Number` using `parseInt` in a variable called `birthYear`.
 - Ask the user for their **lucky number**. Store this value as a `Number` using `parseInt` in a variable called `luckyNumber`.
 - Create **two** `String` type variables called `favFruit` and `favSubject`.
   - `favFruit` should contain your favorite fruit
   - `favSubject` should contain your favorite subject.
 - Show the user the answer to the following questions using alert():
   1. What is the remainder when birthYear is divided by luckyNumber?
   1. What is the value of birthYear + luckyNumber?
   1. What is the value of birthYear + favSubject?
   1. What is the value of favFruit + birthYear + luckyNumber?
   1. What is the value of birthYear + luckyNumber + favSubject?

## Bonus:
Write a two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe in JavaScript. The game should do the following:
 - Alternate turns between the two players, prompting each player to enter his or her move as an index from 1 to 9 (for the nine spots on the board).
 - When prompting the user for a move, display the current state of the board in the prompt.
 - Check that the player entered a valid move: between 1-9, and only free spaces are allowed.
 - After each move, check to see if a player won, or if the game ended in a draw (neither player won).
 - After the game ends, ask the players if they want to start a new game, and start a new game if they do.
