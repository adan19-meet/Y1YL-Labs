# CSS - Lab

## Objective: 
During this lab, you will be improving on the Online Shop you created in the previous lab using the programming language CSS.
The main point of CSS is to style your website and make it more appealing, and that is our final goal.

## Instructions:
1. Create a new file inside your website’s folder and name it “style.css”
2. Open your “home.html” file and add the code below somewhere inside the <head> tag.
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
Note: This will link your CSS document to your HTML document.
3. Now we want to specify an id to the header by writing inside the <h1> tag the following code.<h1 id="header">
Note: This will allow us to change the style of the header separately without influencing any other <h1> tagged code in your HTML document.
4. Inside the CSS document, Change the header’s position on the screen by using the selector id we gave it and the property text-align and change the color of the font (as represented in the example below from the presentation).
5. After you added some items to your online shop, pick the ones with the lowest prices and show their price with a special color that would tell that they are on sale.
We will do that by giving the tag that contains the low prices a specific class called “sale” (as represented in the example below).
6. In the CSS document give a unique color to the prices of items on sale using the selector class we gave it above.


## Bonus:
As a bonus, our goal is to improve our simple navigation bar (from previous lab) and turn it into a Horizontal or Vertical Navigation Bar! (Hint: W3Schools may be very useful)
Improve the About page with the CSS you have learned during this lesson
and look up more ways that suit your liking.



##### Good luck & do your best!
##### Remember to show your wonderful work to your partners and instructors so we can learn from each other.
