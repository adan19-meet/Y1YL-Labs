1. Create a Class called `Car`. every Car object should have a different:
	- `color`: the color of the car.
	- `fuel`: the amount of fuel in the car’s tank in liters.
	- `speed`: the speed at which the car travels in km/h.
	- `fuel_consumption`: how many liters does the car consume for travelling 1 km.
2. Every car can do the following **actions**:
	- `paint_car`: this action paints the car (changes its color) in another color it takes as an argument.
	- `travel`: this action lets the car travel for an amount of time (in hours) that it takes as an argument. After the car travels for x hours, it prints out how many kilometers the car traveled and how many liters of fuel remained in the tank. 
	> (Remember: distance travelled = speed * time and fuel consumed = fuel consumption * distance travelled.)
	- `race_car`: this action makes the car race with another car object which it takes as an argument. After the race, this action prints out the results. The car with the greatest speed wins. However, if the two cars have the same speed, it’s a tie.
	- `fill_tank`: this action adds an amount of fuel (in liters), which it takes as an argument, to the tank.

3. You bought a new car… Congratulations! Your car:
	- is **red**.
	- has **200** liters of fuel in its tank.
	- travels at a velocity of **30** kilometers per hour.
	- consumes **10** liters for every kilometer it travels.
**Create this car as a new object.**  
  
4. You need to go to visit your grandmother. She invited you to lunch, and her food is yummy! Make your car **travel** for half an hour to your grandma’s house. 
	- *Note:* by the end of the ride, your car should have 50 liters of fuel in its tank.

5. You just got married… Congratulations! Your partner doesn’t like your car’s color. **Change your car’s color** to green.

6. You just got divorced. That was fast... and sad, but on the bright side, you get to decide what color you paint your car. **Change your car’s color** to whichever color you wish. No, you can’t just keep it green... you need to move on.

7. Your friend bought a new car too! His car:
	- is **blue**.
	- has **150** liters of fuel in its tank.
	- travels at a velocity of **25** kilometers per hour.
	- consumes **5** liters for every kilometer it travels.
	**Create this car as a new object.**

8. You and your friend went **racing**, who wins?
9. Don’t forget to fill your tank after the race!
